    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen in previous lectures that every intensity matrix generates a\n",
    "Markov semigroup.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have also hinted that the pairing is one-to-one, in a sense to be made precise.\n",
    "\n",
    "To clarify these ideas, we start in an\n",
    "abstract setting, with an arbitrary initial value problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this setting we introduce general operator semigroups and their generators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this is done, we will be able to return to the Markov case and fully\n",
    "clarify the connection between intensity matrices and Markov semigroups.\n",
    "\n",
    "The material below is relatively technical, with most of the\n",
    "complications driven by the fact that the state space can be infinite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such technicalities are hard to avoid, since so many interesting Markov chains\n",
    "do have infinite state spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Our very first example -- the Poisson process -- has an infinite state space.\n",

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The general theory of continuous semigroups of operators is motivated by\n",
