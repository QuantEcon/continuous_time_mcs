Continuous Time Markov Chains
=============================

These lectures provides a short introduction to continuous time Markov chains.
Mathematical ideas are combined with computer code to build intuition and
bridge the gap between theory and applications.  There are many solved
exercises.

The presentation is rigorous but aims toward applications rather than
mathematical curiosities (which are plentiful, if one starts to look).
Applications are drawn from economics, finance and operations research.  I
assume readers have some knowledge of [discrete time Markov
chains](https://python.quantecon.org/finite_markov.html).  Later lectures, use
a small amount of analysis in Banach space.

Code is written in Python and accelerated using
JIT compilation via [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/).  QuantEcon provides an
[introduction to these topics](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/).
